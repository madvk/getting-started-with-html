<b>Computer and the Web</b>
<p>One can tell a computer what to do by writing <em>text</em> that it can understand.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em> Hypertext Markup Language. </em>
HTML is made up of:<br>
- Text: written content<br>
- <em>Markup</em> or what the text looks like; ((markup is used to make it look different))<br>
- May have references to other files, say images or videos<br>
- May have <em>links</em> to other pages

<p>  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good basic overview of HTML.

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b><em>tags</em></b>.<br>
  HTML tags are shown in angled brackets. Most consist of an opening tag (written as < <em>tag</em> >) and a closing tag (written as < <em>tag</em> />). 
  Some do not have a closing tag and are called <em><b>void tags.</b></em><br>
  Everything within a set of opening and closing tags is an <b><em>element.</em></b>

  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains more in detail, including the distinction between these and about the concept of an <b><em>attribute</em></b> as well.

<b>Need to know this about Computers</b>
<p>Computers interpret instructions
  literally, and need to be told everything clearly and exactly. Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands, that is they need to <em>write with correct syntax.</em>
  A small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
